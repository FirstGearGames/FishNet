
This read me is going to be a bit rough. I don't want to delay the testing anymore than we have to, and much of this may change, therefor I'm not going to prettify it for now.
Keep in mind some components are testing placeholders. If you find a component that looks awful and has no commenting, you definitely found one. These will be replaced on release. For anything else please use #fishnet-bugs and #discussion, #content-suggestions, ect.
I'll be making examples progressively, both for testing and release. They can be found in the Examples folder. Note that right now the examples are going to be bare bone, and only aimed to getting started.

I've added a variety of debug messages for now to indicate certain events since there isn't a graphical representation for everything yet.

To get started make your scene and add the prefabs NetworkManager, and NetworkHudCanvas. These are founder under the Example/Prefabs folder.

I've included three components to get started:
- NetworkTransform (drafted), NetworkAnimator (complete), and PlayerSpawner (drafted).
Clients are not bound to their objects like in Mirror; clients may be connected without requiring a player object. The PlayerSpawner demonstrates how to spawn objects for clients. Make sure any objects you want to spawn are under 'Spawnable Objects' in the NetworkManager component; I'd like to make this automatic in the future.

There are no singletons in FishNet, eg: NetworkServer.Instance does not exist. If you would like to access the NetworkManager, ServerManager, ect...
call InstanceFinder.TypeHere.

Most functionality is the same, perhaps worded slightly different, as other solutions. There are the following RPCs and they use your standard [TypeAttribute].
- TargetRpc Method(NetworkConnection target, YourData data); //Send to a single connection.
- ObserversRpc Method(YourData data); //Send to all observers for the object.
- ServerRpc Method(YourData data); //Send to server. Optionally require ownership in attribute.
You can also set which channel to use by specifying the channel at the end of your RPC method. EG:
- ServerRpc Method(YourData data, Channel defaultChannel = Channel.Reliable);

Note: like other solutions most types can be automatically serialized by the code-gen. Unlike Mirror, FishNet will also automatically serialize inheritance. If something cannot be auto serialized you can create your own serializer. This will auto serialize, but as an example:
public struct MyData
{
	public byte Number;
	public string Name;
}

public static class MyCustomSerializers
{
//It's important to lead methods with Write, and Read.
	public static void WriteMyData(this PooledWriter writer, Mydata data)
	{
		writer.WriteByte(Number);
		writer.WriteString(Name);
	}
	public static MyData ReadMyData(this PooledReader reader)
	{
		MyData data = new MyData()
		{
			Number = reader.ReadByte(),
			Name = reader.ReadString()
		};

		return data;
	}

}


There are also SyncVars.
[SyncVar]
private SupportedType _myVariable;

There are many options you can include within the attribute. They are SendRate, ReadPermissions, Channel, and Hook. The hook method must be set like the following.
void MyHook(SupportedType prev, SupportedType next, bool asServer);
The variable names may be whatever you like. AsServer is true if the hook is being called for the server, false if client.
Note: Unreliable SyncVars do not yet have eventual consistency but they will by release.

There are also SyncList and SyncDictionary.
Like Mirror, SyncList are:
private SyncList<SupportedType> _mySyncList = new SyncList<SupportedType>();
Then you treat the synclist as a normal list. You can also subscribe to callbacks using...
_mySyncList.OnChange += Method... EG: a Vector2 synclist would look like this.

void _mySyncList_OnChange(SyncListOperation op, int index, Vector2 oldItem, Vector2 newItem, bool asServer);


NetworkObject is the new NetworkIdentity. All properties exposed outside the class use CamelCase, eg: base.IsServer rather than base.isServer. Authority is renamed to Owner, eg: base.IsOwner. There are also OwnerIsValid, OwnerId, IsHost, IsServerOnly, and many more. You can also compare connection Ids on clients (this is an optional feature). EG you can see if playerA owns objectC from playerB.


There are a ton of callback options for NetworkBehaviour. See NetworkBehaviour.Callbacks file for all of them.


'Broadcast' is another mesasging system. These are the same as 'Messages' in Mirror. Except, in FishNet you can subscribe multiple objects to receive a Broadcast.
To listen to a Broadcast use...
- NetworkManager.Instance.Client.RegisterBroadcast<BroadcastedType>(MethodToCallWhenReceived);
- NetworkManager.Instance.Client.UnregisterBroadcast<BroadcastedType>(MethodToCallWhenReceived);
Broadcast must use the IBroadcast interface. Eg:
public struct MyBroadcast : IBroadcast
{
    public byte Count;
}

You can call a broadcast on the ServerManager, ClientManager, or on a NetworkObject (nob.Broadcast).

FishNet also has a multiple condition system for observers. You can add a NetworkObserver component to a NetworkObject to support observer conditions. Within the NetworkObserver component you will add your ObserverConditions. ObserverConditions are scriptable objects, and you can make your own. To make your own inherit from the ObserverCondition class. To see examples you can view any of the two included conditions:
- SceneCondition, DistanceCondition.
You can make your own as well by right clicking in your project folder and using Create -> FishNet -> Observers.
ScriptableObjects were chosen because it allows you to easily mass modify conditions without having to track down all your objects.


If you are interested in taking advantage of the tick based design you can use the events within TimeManager (NetworkManager.TimeManager). There are several, and they are all commented. EG: OnTick<int>. Tick timing is not fully implemented yet but if you wish to get started you can use those events and they will work.

There's still a lot planned and a lot done that isn't discussed in this read me. Check out the trello for a complete list. https://trello.com/b/taAfXWKP/fishnet-fish-networking
If you would like a feature and it's not on the trello please use the content-suggestions channel.

Note: not all SceneManager examples are complete. Some need to have the NetworkManager removed and replaced with the prefab version.
