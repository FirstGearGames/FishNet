    /// Special reader/writer buffer struct that can be used in Fishnet RPCs or Broadcasts, as arguments or part of structs
    ///
    /// Use cases:
    ///     - replacement for stream sort of
    ///     - instead of always allocating some arrays T[] and sending that over RPCs/Broadcast, you can use SubStream
    ///     - you can pass SubStream into objects via reference 'ref', and those objects write/read state, useful for dynamic length reconcile (items, inventory, buffs, etc...)
    ///     - sending data inside OnServerSpawn to clients via TargetRPC
    ///     - instead of writting custom serializers for big struct, you can use SubStream inside RPCs/Broadcasts
    /// 
    /// Pros:
    ///     - reading is zero copy, reads directly from FishNet buffers
    ///     - everything is pooled
    ///     - ease of use
    ///     - SubStream can also be left uninitialized (default)
    ///     - Can work safely with multiple receivers in Broadcasts, as long as you read data in the same order
    /// Cons:
    ///     - no reading over length protection, you have to know how much data you are reading, due to buffer being red can be larger than substreams buffer
    ///     - writing buffers are also pooled, but there is a copy (since you write into it, then what is written is copied into fishnet internal buffer, but it's byte copy (fast)
    ///     - have to use Dispose() to return buffers to pool, or it may result in memory leak
    ///     - reading in multiple receiver methods (for same client) in Broadcasts, you have extra deserialization processing per each method
    ///     - might be unsafe to use this to send from clients (undefined data length), but so is sending T[] or List<T> from clients
    ///     - not to be used for IReplicateData/input structs, because underlying reading buffer may be changed where as IReplicateData structs are stored internally in replay buffer (substream buffer is not)
    /// 
    /// Note:
    ///     - If you write/read custom structs ONLY via SubStream, automatic serializer will not pick those up. Mark those custom structs with [FishNet.CodeGenerating.IncludeSerialization].
    ///     Codegen detects only custom structs that are used in RPC/Broadcast methods, not in SubStream.
