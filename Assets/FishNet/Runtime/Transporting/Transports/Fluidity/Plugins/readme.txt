ENET Pre-compiled Binary Library Blobs
==========================
This folder contains pre-compiled binaries for a variety of different platforms.

A brief summary of these folders are as follows:

- Windows, Mac, Linux
-- 64bit (x64)

- Android (Kitkat 4.4 minimum target OS)
-- ARMv7 (armeabi-v7a), ARMv8/AArch64 (arm64-v8a)

- iOS 
-- FAT Library (armv7 + arm64). Targeted for iOS 8 minimum. Unsigned library.

DEBUG VERSIONS
===============
Debug versions of the libraries can be obtained at https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/ENet-CSharp/releases.
Otherwise you can also compile the library yourself with Debug enabled.

DOT POINTS
===========
1. 32bit Support for Ignorance has been removed. Originally, I did not want to support 32bit operating systems,
however due to some countries in the world still stuck in the 32bit era (Brasil, some Russian areas, etc) I added them as a
goodwill gesture. However, since those who needed the libraries have now vanished, I have stopped building 32bit versions of ENet.

COMPILE THE CODE YOURSELF
=========================
If you don't trust the above binaries then git clone the ENET-CSharp repository (http://github.com/SoftwareGuy/ENet-CSharp) and read the readme.

EXCLUSION INSTRUCTIONS
======================
No need, the meta data will cover that for you.

Still don't know what to do with these? Drop by the Mirror discord and post in the Ignorance channel.
