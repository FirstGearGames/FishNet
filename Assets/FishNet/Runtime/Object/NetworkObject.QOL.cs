                 * where IsOwner would be true as host but OnStartClient has
                 * not called yet.
                 * 
                 * EG: server will set owner when it spawns the object.
                 * If IsOwner is checked before the object spawns on the
                 * client-host then it would also return true, since the
                 * Owner reference would be the same as what was set by server.

                 * This is however bad when the client hasn't initialized the object
                 * yet because it gives a false sense of execution order. 
                 * As a result, Update or Ticks may return IsOwner as true well before OnStartClient
                 * is called. Many users rightfully create code with the assumption the client has been
                 * initialized by the time IsOwner is true.
                 * 
                 * This is a double edged sword though because now IsOwner would return true
                 * within OnStartNetwork for clients only, but not for host given the client
                 * side won't be initialized yet as host. As a work around CodeAnalysis will
