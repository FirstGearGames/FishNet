                 * initialized by the time IsOwner is true.
                 * 
                 * This is a double edged sword though because now IsOwner would return true
                 * within OnStartNetwork for clients only, but not for host given the client
                 * side won't be initialized yet as host. As a work around CodeAnalysis will
